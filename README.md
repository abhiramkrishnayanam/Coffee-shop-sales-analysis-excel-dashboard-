☕ **Day 5 & 6 of the Entri Elevate Data Analysis Challenge: Coffee Shop Sales Analysis** 📊

I’m excited to share my latest project for the 75-day Data Analysis Challenge by Entri Elevate! This time, I dove deep into analyzing coffee shop sales, and here’s what I accomplished:

✅ Time Series Analysis: Tracked sales performance over time, identifying seasonal trends and patterns to help forecast future sales. 📅

✅ Slicers: Added slicers to my pivot tables and charts, making it easy to filter data interactively by product category, time periods, and more. 🗂️

✅ Conditional Formatting: Highlighted key insights like top-selling items and low sales periods, making it easier to focus on the most important trends. 🌟

✅ Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts: Analyzed sales data across various categories and visualized these insights through detailed pivot charts. 📊

✅ Dashboard Creation: Wrapped up all the insights into an interactive dashboard, providing a comprehensive overview of sales performance and trends. 🎯
